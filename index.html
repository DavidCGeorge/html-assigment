   br> <Article> About Me </Article>
    <p> Hello! My name is <em>David George</em>. I was initally born in St. Catherines, <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr> and lived there until I was <br> nine years old. After that I moved to 
        Almonte, <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr>. Last year I moved to Halifax for a year and <br> now I reside in Ottawa and attend Algonquin Collage. I'm enrolled in the Interactive Media 
        Design program. I very much <br> enjoy using the adobe suite and taking photos using my nikon dslr, or analog Koniko camera. I look forward to <br> progressing these skills 
        as well as learning many more in this program. 
    </p>
    <p> I have many intrests that I enjoy doing. One is I'm really into music. I have a decent sized record collection,<br> some of my favourites are an original box set 
        of <em>George Harrison</em>, All Things Must Pass and an original pressing <br> of <em>Pink Floyd</em>, Dark Side of the Moon. I also play piano and guitar. I took piano lessons for seven years 
        and <br> have my grade six Royal Conservatory certificate. I am self taught in guitar. I have a baby Martin accustic <br> guitar and a Mexican Fender Straticaster for electric. I am 
        a massive <em>Kanye West</em> fan, but listen too and enjoy all types of music.
